### Tech Stack 🏗️

- [Styled-component]() for the styling.

2. `cd` into the `/src` folder
3. Run `npm install`
4. The check for `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Challenges 🩹

1. The biggest challenge i faced was getting the value of the button when it was created with Styled-component, but the fix was relatively easy.
2. Styling, coming up with the right css for the design required planning before writing it. I utilized flex-box css which i am more comfortable using.
3. Time, I struggled to fix it in the initial 3 hours because of the debugging and trying a way of handling floats in Typescript made took more time than initial stated.

### Future Features 🚧

1. Given more time, fixing the user input of floats would be a good feature to complete the application requirements.
2. Feature suggestion, Add a decimal key on the keypad would help with the user inputing the decimal numbers with ease.
